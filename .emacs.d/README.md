# Emacs

## housekeeping

* [install emacs](http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Installing_Emacs_on_OS_X)
* symlink the `.emacs.d` dir --> `ln -s ~/dotfiles/.emacs.d/  ~/.emacs.d`

**NOTE:** The above is for OSX.  Please note to follow the Homebrew recommended install path.

# Quickstart

After you symlink, nothing else should be required as the customizations set are basic.

# Questions

> Why was this not included in the setup script?

I opted to leave this out because not everyone is going to want/need to use emacs.  I also feel that if you are using it, you likely have your own `.emacs.d` files.

# Kong Journey

Prior to the emacs config I have here, I spent at least a day trying to initially learn emacs customization by studying the kong emacs configs.  You can see how this journey played out by checking out `ef36d7762963d98d6d481139d98ae7651f15df39`.
